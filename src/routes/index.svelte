<h3>Who am I?</h3>

<p>
    My name is <b>Aymeric</b>. I'm a computer science <b>student</b>
    currently studying in
    <b>France</b>. I enjoy writing <b>software</b> and
    <b>reverse-engineering</b> things. I like low-level programming, security and
    understanding how things work. I also make chill music, take a listen.
</p>

<p>
    This project started as a portfolio but I decided to take it to the next
    level. Checkout my <a href="/blog">blog</a> where I mostly write about my
    <b>projects</b>, or listen to some of my
    <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hyperwavmusic">music</a> :D
