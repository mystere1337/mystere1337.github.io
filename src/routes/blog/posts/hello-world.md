### Introduction

I started this project as an excuse to learn that new web framework that popped quite recently to make a portfolio, however the project took an unexpected turn. So here's my website, written in Svelte.

### Why Svelte?

Fist of all, as I don't particularly like doing web development, I wanted someting fast to code and simple to use yet efficient. Svelte's development started way after ReactJS, Vue or Angular so we could expect some lacks in functionnality, however I feel like it took the best from them while adding it's own rules. Today it is used by companies like Apple, IBM and others.

It is very clean and simple to use, with component files being split in 3 parts, script, html and css which I find it much more concise than it's concurrents for smaller scale apps like this website.

### So what's the purpose of this website?

This project was supposed to be my portfolio but as I said in the introduction, it took a turn. Since a portfolio isn't really interesting and much more like a showcase, I decided to add a blog to it. Don't know how long I'll be posting or if I ever will, but I'd like to write about the things I learn through my coding journey. Maybe reverse-engineering, os programming, hacking?

I'd also like to write about some of my projects that I will not publicly upload any sources online, like the software I write in the different companies I work at.
